===========

This repo contains my custom scripts for my various pen-testing needs

1. google_curl
Script that automates specific google searches.  This particulare script is used to discover subdomains given a particular domain.  Try DNS zone transfers first, but most likely the name server won't allow it, thus this script was born.
